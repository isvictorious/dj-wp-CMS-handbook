<h2 id="projects-overview" class="anchor-heading">Overview</h2>


When building editorial tools that work with WordPress we follow a set of standards that fit within our publishing pipeline.

This is a regularly updated list of active projects, future projects, and deprecated projects that are no longer maintained. 

Before starting a new project you should consult these project repositories and their authors to see if something is already in the works.

All plugins & themes go through a review process after development to ensure they meet cross organizational guidelines.

Syntax and formatting are keys to a maintainable project. By keeping our code style consistent, we not only help ourselves debug faster but we're also lessening the burden on those who will have to maintain our code (maybe ourselves too!).
