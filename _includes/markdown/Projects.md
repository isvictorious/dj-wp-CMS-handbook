At 10up, we value content and the experience users will have reading it. We write CSS with this in mind and don't sacrifice our clients' most important assets over the latest, shiniest, half-supported CSS features just for the sake of using them. CSS should help enhance content, not bury it under "cool" distractions.

Our websites are built mobile first, using performant CSS. Well-structured CSS yields maintainability and better collaboration which ultimately yields better client experiences.

Syntax and formatting are keys to a maintainable project. By keeping our code style consistent, we not only help ourselves debug faster but we're also lessening the burden on those who will have to maintain our code (maybe ourselves too!).
