<h2 id="goal" class="anchor-heading">Goal {% include Util/top %}</h2>

The WordPress open source project is a publishing tool that powers over 30% of the internet's top 10 million sites. The project is led by a large community of developers, designers, & others.

By not having internal standards for WordPress across organizations, Dow Jones as a whole does not benefit from each WordPress project.

By following a unified best practices aligned with the WordPress community at Dow Jones, we can better leverage community gains & save considerable resources.


<h2 id="philosophy" class="anchor-heading">Philosophy {% include Util/top %}</h2>

> "Hackathon ready."

Keep it simple. If your plugin or tool requires multiple API keys, depdendcies, and a mini course to fire up, you are creating friction for those who may want to contribute to your project.

> "How will others use this?"

One of the great things about WordPress is the robust library of maintained plugins. When building WordPress projects at Dow Jones think of how your project can benefit others. In kind, you will gain project benefits from others.
